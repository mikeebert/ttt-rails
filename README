Notes:

TicTacToe Game in Ruby & Rails made with the following guidelines:
- Allow for a human player
- Play against a human
- Have some user interface, text is fine
- Win whenever possible, and never lose

If you have rails installed you can download it to your local machine, run rails server, and navigate to localhost:3000

Notes:
I KNOW there's a better way than all of the "if" statements and checking for action in the defensive/offensive moves. Looking forward to learning how.

Should the computer actions/logic be placed in a module?

I'd like to know why my routes were being so stubborn on the button_to (hence resources plus the two named routes).

So much refactoring to be done.
